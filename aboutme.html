			<p class="text-justify" id="mycontent">In January 30, 1996 in the kingdom of Sindaton. A princess was born, named Angelie Rose B. Nalugon, she was a very lovely baby. Every person in her family loves her very much. LOL
				</p>
			
			<h1 id="head1"><b>Inspirational</b></h1>
			
			<p class="text-justify" id="mycontent">This area might make you want to sing "Parang di ko kayang bumitaw" HAHA</p>
			<ul> 
				<li class="text-justify">"I have heard so many of you say you felt “stupid” for staying and trying to make it work even when deep down inside you knew nothing would ever change.

				My dear Beautiful Strong Woman... you were never “stupid.” You were in love, and real love is not something a Good Woman simply walks away from. She fights for it! She cries for it!She holds on to it until it burns at the very core of her soul.

				No... you were never “stupid.” You were real. If anyone was stupid, it was the Wrong Man who lost you. Why? Because he may never know just how close he came to receiving the blessing of a lifetime."</li>

				<li class="text-justify">A strong woman is self-defined. She knows that the only definition of her that matters is her own.
				You define yourself. You have total control over who you are as a woman; no man has the power to take that from you unless you give it to him.</li>

				<li class="text-justify">“I hope when you woke up this morning, you looked in
				the mirror and saw exactly what I see when I look at
				you… an incredibly beautiful woman who is unique
				and deserving of all the love and attention
				that a good man has to offer.”</li>

				<li class="text-justify">“More often than not, it’s the little things thatmatter most.”
				I hope he noticed that you had your hair done in a different style or the fact that you painted your
				nails that new color you’ve been wanting to try. I hope he noticed that new outfit you bought to wear
				just for him. I hope he noticed and complimented you on them. If not, let me be the first…you look
				amazing!</li>
